User: What is Chronic kidney disease
Bot: Chronic kidney disease may not become apparent until your kidney function is significantly impaired. Overview

Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, describes the gradual loss of kidney function. Chronic kidney disease can progress to end-stage kidney failure, which is fatal without artificial filtering (dialysis) or a kidney transplant.

Bot: In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, you may have few signs or symptoms. When to see a doctor

Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs or symptoms of kidney disease. If you have a medical condition that increases your risk of kidney disease, your doctor is likely to monitor your blood pressure and kidney function with urine and blood tests during regular office visits.
