which are then excreted in your urine.', 'When chronic kidney disease reaches an advanced stage, dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes can build up in your body.', 'In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, you may have few signs or symptoms.', 'Chronic kidney disease may not become apparent until your kidney function is significantly impaired.', 'Treatment for chronic kidney disease focuses on slowing the progression of the kidney damage, usually by controlling the underlying cause.', 'Chronic kidney disease can progress to end-stage kidney failure, which is fatal without artificial filtering (dialysis) or a kidney transplant.', 'Chronic kidney disease care at Mayo Clinic\\n\\nHow kidneys work\\n\\nSymptoms\\n\\nSigns and symptoms of chronic kidney disease develop over time if kidney damage progresses slowly.', \"Signs and symptoms of kidney disease may include:\\n\\nNausea\\n\\nVomiting\\n\\nLoss of appetite\\n\\nFatigue and weakness\\n\\nSleep problems\\n\\nChanges in how much you urinate\\n\\nDecreased mental sharpness\\n\\nMuscle twitches and cramps\\n\\nSwelling of feet and ankles\\n\\nPersistent itching\\n\\nChest pain, if fluid builds up around the lining of the heart\\n\\nShortness of breath, if fluid builds up in the lungs\\n\\nHigh blood pressure (hypertension) that's difficult to control\\n\\nSigns and symptoms of kidney disease are often nonspecific, meaning they can also be caused by other illnesses.\", 'Because your kidneys are highly adaptable and able to compensate for lost function, signs and symptoms may not appear until irreversible damage has occurred.', 'When to see a doctor\\n\\nMake an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs or symptoms of kidney disease.', 'If you have a medical condition that increases your risk of kidney disease, your doctor is likely to monitor your blood pressure and kidney function with urine and blood tests during regular office visits.', 'Ask your doctor whether these tests are necessary for you.', 'Causes\\n\\nNormal kidney vs. diseased kidney Open pop-up dialog box Close Normal kidney vs. diseased kidney Normal kidney vs. diseased kidney A normal kidney has about 1 million filtering units.', 'Each unit, called a glomerulus, connects to a tubule, which collects urine.', 'Conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes take a toll on kidney function by damaging these filtering units and collecting tubules and causing scarring.', \"Polycystic kidney Open pop-up dialog box Close Polycystic kidney Polycystic kidney A healthy kidney (left) eliminates waste from the blood and maintains the body's normal chemical balance.\", 'With polycystic kidney disease (right), fluid-filled sacs called cysts develop in the kidneys, causing them to grow larger and gradually lose their ability to function normally.', 'Chronic kidney disease occurs when a disease or condition impairs kidney function, causing kidney damage to worsen over several months or years.', \"Diseases and conditions that cause chronic kidney disease include:\\n\\nType 1 or type 2 diabetes\\n\\nHigh blood pressure\\n\\nGlomerulonephritis (gloe-mer-u-low-nuh-FRY-tis), an
